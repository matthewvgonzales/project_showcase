# Project 1: Austin Animal Center Data Analysis

This project demonstrates my ability to clean and manipulate data, as well as perform exploratory data analysis. The dataset comes from the Austin Animal Center, a no-kill animal shelter in Austin, Texas, covering records from 2013 to February 2025.

Project Objectives

Import and preprocess data

Perform data cleaning and wrangling

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize key insights

Technologies Used

Python 3.11.11

Pandas 2.2.2

NumPy 1.26.4

Matplotlib

Data Cleaning & Wrangling

Removed redundant columns (e.g., MonthYear was dropped in favor of DateTime)

Dropped Outcome_Subtype due to substantial missing values

Processed age_upon_outcome to ensure consistent formatting and usability

Converted relevant columns (e.g., Animal_Type, Animal_ID) to categorical data to optimize memory usage

Converted date-related columns to datetime format

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed trends in animal outcomes over time

Identified patterns in animal types, breeds, and ages

Visualized outcome distributions to understand adoption trends

Acknowledgments

This project serves as a demonstration of my data analysis skills. While substantial cleaning and EDA were performed, additional analysis could be conducted to further explore insights from the data.
